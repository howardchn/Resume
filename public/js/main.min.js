Another challenge is that, we are building this feature upon a pretty stable system, we need to guarantee the function are not harmed by our newly feature, so we need to make decision on various situations. One interesting things we met is that, the time zone library provided by Java has different versions that are corresponded to Java version, so the UI client time zone database's version should be synced. After this project, I provided a company-wide presentation with this function and experience. This must helpful for the other developers.

Then refactor the namespace, re-arrange the classes into its corresponding namespaces, so that we could easier target a class by its ability. Once the assemblies are splitted, we design the new redistribution on NuGet to help user to reference our assemblies easier without installation anymore. My responsibility is to refactor almost all .NET map control in Map Suite family that covers WPF, WinForms, WebForm, WebAPI, Mvc, Xamarin for iOS, Android platforms; redesign the assemblies, namespaces; then re-allocate the proper classes into the corresponding namespaces to make related classes tightly integrated.
